You can now exclude folders from being precached and uploaded.

To do this, simply write the folder path in a configuration file located at configs/SDownloader/ExclusionList_~~~.cfg.

For example, if you want to exclude the materials folder, open ExclusionList_materials.txt and add a line like "materials/trails".

This method can be applied to other types of resources as well.
